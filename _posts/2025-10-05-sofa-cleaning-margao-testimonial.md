As summer humidity in Margao creeps in, our living room sofa began to show it — sweat stains from kids, coffee spills from guests, and a general musty smell that no amount of DIY scrubbing could fix.  

Frustrated, I searched for a professional cleaning service and found **Goa Shine Cleaning Services** via their sofa cleaning page ([www.goashinecs.com/sofa-cleaning-services-goa.html](https://www.goashinecs.com/sofa-cleaning-services-goa.html)).

## 🛋️ The Sofa Situation

We have a three‑seater fabric sofa, plus two single armchairs. One cushion had a coffee spill that dried over time. There was visible dirt in the seams, and even the non‑fabric parts (wooden arms, base) looked dusty and dull.

## ✨ Booking & the Cleaning Day

Booking was simple — a call to **81779 10672**, confirming schedule, discussing fabric type (fabric + leather mixed) and requesting stain‑treatment. A quote arrived, transparent and fair.

On the cleaning day:

- Team came with portable steam cleaners, upholstery brushes, gentle stain removers  
- Started with fabric surfaces, treated stains first  
- Vacuumed seams, scrubbed lightly where dirt had built up  
- Cleaned the wooden parts and polished them  
- Deodorized fabrics with non‑toxic, fresh‑smelling agents

## 🔍 Results That Made A Difference

- Fabrics looked brighter and seams cleaner  
- The smell — gone. It now smells fresh, almost like new  
- Leather/leather‑like parts regained shine; no sticky feeling  
- Cushions felt fluffier; seatingfelt more comfortable  
- Guests visiting that evening commented on how “fresh and new” the living area looked
