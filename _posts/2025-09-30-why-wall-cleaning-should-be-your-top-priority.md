## 🧽 Walls Collect More Dirt Than You Realize

Dust, smoke, grease from cooking, and even fingerprints silently build up on your walls every day. Over time, this grime can cause discoloration, stains, and even damage paint or wallpaper.

Ignoring wall cleaning can leave your home looking dull and tired — even if everything else is spotless.
