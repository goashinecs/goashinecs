Moving into a new apartment in **Porvorim** sounds exciting — until you realize just how dusty and grimy an "unoccupied but ready" place can be.

The flat looked okay at first glance, but a closer look showed dirt in the fans, kitchen cabinets, stains on the floors, and a general feeling that it hadn’t been deep-cleaned in months.

I wanted the place **fully cleaned and sanitized before moving in** with my family, so I contacted **Goa Shine Cleaning Services** after a friend recommended them.

## 🧽 Cleaning Day – Smooth and Professional

Their team arrived on time in uniform, carrying tools, vacuum cleaners, disinfectants, mops, and ladders. The entire process took about **5 hours** — but the transformation was more than worth it.

Here’s what impressed us:

- Fans were cleaned without leaving dirt on the floor  
- Kitchen cabinets were **scrubbed and deodorized**  
- Bathrooms looked brand new — including tiles, taps, and floor drains  
- All floor areas were **mopped, scrubbed, and sanitized**  
- The team even wiped curtain rods, door edges, and high corners  

They worked **room by room**, kept everything clean as they went, and even helped us move one large cupboard to clean behind it.

## 🧴 Post-Cleaning Smell: Not Strong, Just Fresh

Unlike chemical-heavy services, Goa Shine used **safe, non-toxic disinfectants** that left a fresh, hotel-like smell. Perfect since we were moving in the same day with kids.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

We walked into a **dust-free, sanitized, and sparkling apartment** — ready to be called home. Goa Shine didn’t just clean surfaces — they cleaned behind, under, and inside everything. Truly professional.
