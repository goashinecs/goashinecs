Water is life — but only when it’s clean. Most people don’t realize how much dirt, algae, and harmful bacteria build up in their **underground and overhead water tanks** over time. Regular cleaning is essential for your health and your plumbing.

At **Goa Shine Cleaning Services**, we offer professional **water tank cleaning in Goa** for homes, housing societies, commercial buildings, and more.

## 💧 Why Water Tank Cleaning is Important

- Prevents harmful bacteria and virus growth  
- Removes sludge, algae, and silt buildup  
- Ensures cleaner, better-smelling water  
- Reduces plumbing blockages and damage  
- Helps avoid waterborne diseases like typhoid, diarrhea, and cholera  

Regular cleaning should be done **every 6 months** for optimal hygiene.

## 🧽 Our 6-Step Water Tank Cleaning Process

1. **Tank Draining**  
   We safely drain all water from the tank before cleaning begins.

2. **Sludge Removal**  
   Our team manually scrapes and vacuums out all silt, dirt, and waste from the tank floor and walls.

3. **High-Pressure Cleaning**  
   We use high-pressure jet sprays to dislodge algae, mold, and grime buildup.

4. **Anti-Bacterial Scrubbing**  
   Internal surfaces are scrubbed with **non-toxic, food-safe disinfectants** to kill germs and biofilm.

5. **UV Treatment / Disinfection**  
   We apply **chlorine or UV-based solutions** to sterilize the tank and destroy remaining microorganisms.

6. **Final Rinse & Drying**  
   The tank is thoroughly rinsed with clean water and air-dried before refilling.
