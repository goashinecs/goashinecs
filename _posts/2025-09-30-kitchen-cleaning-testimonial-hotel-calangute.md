Operating a star hotel in Calangute means the kitchen isn’t just a back‑room — it’s the heart of our guest experience. When the peak tourist season hit last year, our kitchen equipment, exhaust hoods, and cold storage were under relentless pressure — grease buildup, stale odors, and slippery floors became daily challenges.

## 🌟 First Impressions with Goa Shine

A colleague recommended **Goa Shine Cleaning Services** after seeing their work in another hotel nearby. I reached out via their website and their team responded with clear questions: what kind of equipment we had, how often we cook seafood versus dry food, and whether our exhaust hood needed degreasing.

We scheduled a deep‑clean between two service hours, when guests were in on lunch duty but not yet for dinner. The team came with industrial degreasers, power washers, scrapers, and PPE. They arrived punctually, and that set the tone immediately.

## 🔧 What the Cleaning Process Included

Over two days, this is what they did:

- Disassembled and cleaned exhaust hoods & filters to remove thick grease layers  
- Scrubbed oil traps, behind stovetops, burners, and the flue  
- Sanitized the cold rooms and walk‑in refrigerators, cleaned racks, and sealed any mold spots  
- Degreased ovens, deep‑cleaned tile grouts, sanitized sinks & drains  
- Sanitization of counters, cutting surfaces, switchboards, and pest‑control check around food prep areas  
- Polished steel surfaces and ensured non‐slip flooring was clean and dry

Afterwards, they provided us with a report of areas cleaned, before & after photos, and advised a maintenance schedule to prevent buildup.
