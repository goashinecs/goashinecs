- Dust accumulation on walls, ceilings, and windows  
- Paint splatters and adhesive residues  
- Cement dust on floors, tiles, and fixtures  
- Debris, packaging materials, and leftover construction waste  
- Sanitization of bathrooms, kitchens, and living spaces  

This ensures the property is **safe, hygienic, and aesthetically ready** for occupation.
