Living in Goa during the monsoons is a different experience altogether — lush greenery, cooler air, and… well, a lot of moisture. If you’re not careful, your home can quickly become a breeding ground for mold, damp smells, and pests.

Here are some **practical seasonal cleaning tips** to get your home monsoon-ready — and keep it that way.

---

## 🌧️ 1. Start with a Deep Clean

Before the rains arrive in full swing, schedule a **full-home deep clean**. Focus on:

- Bathrooms and kitchens (common mold zones)  
- Window tracks and sills  
- Corners behind furniture  
- Ceiling fans and exhaust vents

These areas trap moisture and dust — the perfect recipe for fungus.

---

## 🧼 2. Mold-Proof Your Surfaces

Use **vinegar-based sprays** or anti-fungal solutions on:

- Wardrobe interiors  
- Wooden cabinets  
- Shoe racks  
- Under-sink storage areas

Also, keep camphor or moisture absorbers like silica gel in drawers and closets.

---

## 🪟 3. Check Windows and Door Seals

Inspect all entry points for water leakage. Use sealant tape for minor gaps, or hire a handyman if you notice large cracks or gaps. Leaky windows are the number one reason homes start smelling musty during the rains.

---

## 🧹 4. Clean Floors More Frequently

Dirt and moisture come in quickly during monsoon. Mop with a **disinfectant + warm water** combo, especially near entryways. Add a second doormat (one outside, one inside) to control muddy footprints.

---

## 🦟 5. Prevent Pests Early

Monsoons in Goa = mosquito and cockroach season. Clean:

- Drains and kitchen sinks regularly  
- Food crumbs from corners  
- Stagnant water near balconies or bathrooms

Place mosquito repellents in living and sleeping areas, and consider a **non-toxic pest treatment** in advance.

---

## 👃 6. Keep the Air Fresh

Leave wardrobes slightly open during dry hours. Use a fan to circulate air in unused rooms. Natural room fresheners with neem, eucalyptus, or citrus oils help keep things fresh without overpowering your space.

---

## 🧴 7. Sanitize High-Touch Surfaces

Rainwater can carry bacteria. Wipe down:

- Doorknobs  
- Switches  
- Remote controls  
- Shoe racks

Do this at least 2–3 times a week.

---

The monsoon brings beauty — but also challenges. A clean, mold-free, fresh-smelling home makes the season more enjoyable and healthy for you and your family.
