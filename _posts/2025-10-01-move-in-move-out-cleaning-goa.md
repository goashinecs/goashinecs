If you've ever rented an apartment in Goa, you know how stressful moving day can be. Packing boxes is one thing, but scrubbing a whole flat before handing over the keys? That’s a level of stress I wasn’t prepared for — until I found **Goa Shine Cleaning Services**.

## 📦 My Moving-Out Mess

I was living in a 1BHK in Mapusa for about 11 months. As the lease ended, my landlord insisted the flat be left in “move-in condition” for the next tenant. It made sense — I just didn't have the time or energy to deep clean it after packing everything.

A friend suggested hiring **professional move-out cleaners**, and that’s how I came across **Goa Shine's move-in move-out cleaning services**.

## 🧼 What They Did Was Beyond Expectations

I booked them through their website ([www.goashinecs.com](https://www.goashinecs.com)) and got a confirmation call within an hour. The next day, a team of two arrived right on time — fully equipped and wearing branded uniforms.

They handled everything:

- Deep cleaning of kitchen countertops, cabinets, and exhaust fan  
- Descaling bathroom tiles and sanitizing fixtures  
- Wiping windows, doors, and switchboards  
- Sweeping, mopping, and polishing floors  
- Removing cobwebs and wiping ceiling corners  
- Cleaning the balcony, fans, and lights

It took about 3 hours — and they didn’t leave a speck behind.

## 🏠 Move-In Cleaning Too?

Yes! A week later, I used their **move-in cleaning service** for my new place near Margao. This time it wasn’t about mess — the flat was technically “clean” — but it still had construction dust, stains on the windows, and an odd damp smell.

The same Goa Shine team made the space feel fresh, livable, and spotless.

They even:

- Disinfected all surfaces  
- Cleaned out the water tank  
- Treated the bathroom and kitchen with anti-bacterial solution  
- Deodorized the space with eco-friendly agents

## ✅ Why I’d Recommend Goa Shine

- Punctual and polite team  
- Transparent pricing — no hidden fees  
- Eco-friendly products used  
- Attention to detail (they even cleaned behind the fridge!)  
- Flexible booking — I confirmed both jobs via WhatsApp  

For tenants and landlords alike, **move-in/move-out cleaning in Goa** isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity. Goa Shine makes it simple and stress-free.
