I’ve never written a review for a cleaning service before — but after what **Goa Shine Cleaning Services** did for my bathroom, I felt it was only fair to share.

As someone living in a rented apartment in Vasco for over two years, I’ve tried everything from baking soda DIY hacks to store-bought cleaners to keep my bathroom looking decent. But over time, water stains, hard-to-reach corners, and general wear made it feel constantly dirty — no matter how much I scrubbed.

## 🛁 Why I Called Goa Shine

I came across [Goa Shine’s bathroom cleaning page](https://www.goashinecs.com/bathroom-cleaning-goa.html) while browsing for professional cleaners. I wasn’t sure what to expect but decided to give them a try after seeing how quick it was to book.

One call to **81779 10672**, and I had an appointment scheduled for the next morning. The staff even confirmed the appointment on WhatsApp, which was super convenient.

## ✨ The Transformation

The cleaning team arrived right on time, in uniform, and fully equipped. I didn’t need to provide any supplies. Over the next two hours, they:

- Removed every trace of water stains and soap scum from tiles and taps  
- Deep cleaned the toilet and sink (including under the rim and drain)  
- Scrubbed grout lines back to white  
- Polished the mirror and wiped the ceiling corners  
- Even cleaned the tiny exhaust fan and deodorized the space  

I couldn’t believe it — my old, dull bathroom looked like it belonged in a hotel.

## 💬 What Impressed Me Most

- **No mess**: They left the bathroom spotless with no residue or water on the floor  
- **Eco-friendly products**: It smelled fresh but not overpowering  
- **Respectful team**: They didn’t ask unnecessary questions or touch anything outside the bathroom  
- **Clear pricing**: No extra charges or surprises  

The result? The bathroom looked cleaner than when I moved in — and I genuinely felt better using it.
