**Deep cleaning includes:**

- Steam-cleaning tiles, sinks, and counters  
- Removing cobwebs and dust from ceilings and fans  
- Cleaning under furniture and behind appliances  
- Polishing windows, mirrors, and glass partitions  
- Restoring shine to floors and tiles  

This level of cleaning not only makes your property look spotless but also improves air quality and reduces allergens — important in humid coastal areas like Calangute.
