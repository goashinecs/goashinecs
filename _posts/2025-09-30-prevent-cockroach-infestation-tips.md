Cockroaches are more than just unpleasant to look at — they carry bacteria, contaminate food, and trigger allergies. If you’ve spotted even one in your home, chances are there are more hiding.

At **Goa Shine Cleaning Services**, we regularly assist homes and businesses across Goa in fighting pest infestations. Here’s what our professionals recommend to **prevent cockroach infestations before they start**.

---

## 🧼 1. Keep Your Kitchen Clean — Always

Cockroaches are drawn to food crumbs, grease, and standing water. Make it a habit to:

- Wipe kitchen counters after cooking  
- Sweep/mop the floor daily  
- Keep sink free of dirty dishes overnight  
- Store food in airtight containers  
- Empty garbage bins every evening  

Even a single dirty plate left overnight can attract them.

---

## 🚿 2. Eliminate Moisture & Leaks

Roaches love damp places. Check for:

- Leaky pipes under sinks  
- Wet mops left in corners  
- AC drip trays  
- Poor bathroom ventilation  

Fix leaks promptly and use exhaust fans or dehumidifiers to reduce moisture.

---

## 🚫 3. Seal Entry Points

Cockroaches sneak in through:

- Cracks in walls or tile joints  
- Gaps near drains, windows, or under doors  
- Broken exhaust fan covers  

Use caulk or sealants to close these gaps. Install fine mesh on drain holes.

---

## 🧴 4. Use Safe Cockroach Baits & Gels

Instead of toxic sprays, consider:

- **Boric acid paste** (applied under sinks or behind appliances)  
- **Cockroach gel baits** — available at most supermarkets or online  
- **Natural repellents** like bay leaves or neem oil  

Place them in corners, cabinets, and crevices — away from pets and kids.

---

## 🧽 5. Don’t Forget Hidden Zones

During our pest control visits in Goa, we often find cockroach nests in unexpected areas:

- Behind refrigerators or washing machines  
- Inside electrical panels  
- In kitchen chimney ducts  
- Under bathroom cabinets  

Make sure to clean or inspect these regularly.

- See roaches during the day  
- Spot droppings or egg cases  
- Notice a musty smell  
- Hear scurrying sounds at night  

…it’s time to call **Goa Shine’s pest control team**. We use safe, odorless, and government-approved solutions to target nests and stop reproduction.
