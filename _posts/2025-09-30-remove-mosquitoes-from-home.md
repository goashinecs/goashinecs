If you've ever tried to fall asleep with a mosquito buzzing near your ear, you know how frustrating it can be. I used to think mosquitoes were just an outdoor problem — until they took over my living room one monsoon evening in Goa.

Here’s how I **actually got rid of mosquitoes inside my house**, without turning it into a fog of chemicals or resorting to DIY hacks that don’t really work.

---

## 🪟 1. Find Out How They’re Getting In

My first mistake? Leaving small windows cracked open without mesh. Even 10 minutes was enough for a dozen mosquitoes to fly in.

What I did:

- Installed fine **mosquito mesh** on all windows  
- Kept **bathroom doors closed** (they love damp corners)  
- Checked for gaps near drains and AC units

Just sealing entry points made a massive difference.

## 💡 2. Ditch the Coils – Try Electric Traps Instead

I used coils and sprays for weeks. They smelled awful and barely worked. Eventually, I invested in a **UV mosquito trap** — and it quietly did the job overnight.

Highly recommend:

- **Indoor mosquito traps** with no sound or fumes  
- Placing one near the kitchen and one in the bedroom  
- Switching off lights when using them (mosquitoes follow light and heat)

## 🌿 3. Natural Ways That Actually Help

Some natural remedies do work — if used correctly.

Here’s what I tried that gave decent results:

- **Burning camphor** in a bowl of water for 20 minutes (windows closed)  
- Using **neem oil + coconut oil** as a skin repellent  
- **Lemongrass and citronella diffusers** to keep them away from corners

Don’t expect miracles, but they helped keep new mosquitoes out.

## 🚫 4. Standing Water? Get Rid of It — Immediately

Turns out, mosquitoes were **breeding in my potted plant trays** and near the washing machine drain.

Check for:

- Open buckets or utensils collecting rainwater  
- Flower pot bases  
- Bathroom floor traps  
- Pet bowls left out overnight

Empty them daily. Add a few drops of kerosene or bleach in outdoor drains if needed.

## 🧼 5. One Deep Clean Changed Everything

The final step? I booked a **professional mosquito control and cleaning service** through Goa Shine. They used non-toxic treatment for corners, drains, behind furniture, and even sprayed safe repellents on window sills and vents.

Within 48 hours, there wasn’t a mosquito in sight. I finally got a full night’s sleep without that annoying buzzing.
